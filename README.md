## Description
This is a basic memory game where I practiced custom HTML tags, classes, event listeners, and if statements

## Technology

HTML, 
CSS, 
Vanilla JS

## Roadmap

In the future, I need to fiddle with the timings on some things as when you get to the end of the game, the alert comes up before the matched colors render on the page, as well as the "times up" text when you run out of time.
